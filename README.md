# Weather App

This is a Node.js web service for retrieving weather information for regions and states. The service utilizes the Mapbox API to fetch the geocode for a specific region, and then uses the Weatherstack API to obtain the corresponding weather information.

## Usage

To test the web service and access weather information, visit the following URL: [https://eslam-weather-app.onrender.com](https://eslam-weather-app.onrender.com).

The website provides the following functionality:

- **Weather Search**: Use the search feature to retrieve weather information for a desired region or state.
- **About**: Learn more about the weather app and its purpose.
- **Help**: Access assistance and guidance for using the service.

## How it Works

When a region or state is entered into the search feature, the web service communicates with the Mapbox API to fetch the geocode for that location. This geocode is then used to request weather information from the Weatherstack API. The web service ensures accurate and up-to-date weather data.

## Developer

This weather app was created by Eslam Ahmed.

Please note that using the web service may require API keys for the Mapbox and Weatherstack APIs. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and permissions before using the service.
